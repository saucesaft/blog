It is definetly easier and cheaper to add some if statements to a program than physical functionality.

Recently i've had to develop some software that needed to interface an Arduino, well it wasn't originally like that. It was supposed to have some lcds and 8-segment displays which the arduino could drive and show temperature values via sensors. The problem was that I had to modify my whole plan because of the complexity involving electrical components, specially the LCD. I needed to connect more than 6 cables just for having that ugly screen, plus transistors and potentiometers the internet reccomended. I got to the point were it was exhausting to connect every single pin so I just decided to hook up a Bluetooth module which will redirect the sensor values to my computer.

The following is a tweet reply from someone on the internet that bought a chinese 18650 lamp and discovered a whole new world of flashlight firmware. He explains that there are
