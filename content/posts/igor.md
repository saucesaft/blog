Just watched tyler's camp flog gnaw live concert and this came out of my hands;

Igor's theme:
- Running from past songs, albums, setting the principal mood for the album.
- Experimenting with new vocals.
- Agresive mixture
- Femenine voice
- Delightful piano chords
- Exact word repetition
- **sounds effects**

I think:
- Maybe taking decisions back
- Imiting critics
- Curiosity killed the felline
- Love as inspiration, explaining it
- How can i tell you?
- Nice moves
- Nice finale

A boy's a gun:
- Competence?
- When the time's right
- dont say no to me // dont shoot me **down**
- love's own defects
- mixed feelings

New magic wand:
- Like magic
- Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
- I need to get her outta the picture
- please dont leave me now
- like magic, we can finally be together?
- i pick you both, its not a joke
- decision?
- what are you doing?
- clear decision, clear ideas
- i want to be your number one
- escape

Puppet:
- Is this really working
- Do i really want this?
- i need your company
- what is your wish?
- is this my freedom or yours?
- im your puppet
- i dont know me
- am in in love with u?

Earfquakeeeeeee:
- Interlude represents a break, the necessity.
- I need (miss) you, you make my earth quake.
- its my fault
- **cardisynths**
- taxi honk
- for real, (my love), this time
- shes going... (but he doesnt want)
- its my fault
- failed attempt (it all comes crashing down)
- is there any truth really?

Nice

Discography gravitating...

IFHY:
- breakup
