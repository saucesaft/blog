      <description>It is definetly easier and cheaper to add some if statements to a program than physical functionality.
Recently i&amp;rsquo;ve had to develop some software that needed to interface an Arduino, well it wasn&amp;rsquo;t originally like that. It was supposed to have some lcds and 8-segment displays which the arduino could drive and show temperature values via sensors. The problem was that I had to modify my whole plan because of the complexity involving electrical components, specially the LCD.</description>
