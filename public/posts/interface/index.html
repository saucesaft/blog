				<p>What&rsquo;s the purpose of a calculator? Calculate. What&rsquo;s the pupose of some digital callipers? Measure.
Just some vague examples of old (really old) computing. People like Ada Loveace set the standards for modern
computing. During World War 2, the germans developed the Engima Machine, rasing the bar of encryption.
British geniuses reunited and developed an algorithm to break the cypher, if done manually would take constant
days of work, bad thing that the Germans changed the hash every 12 hours.</p>
<p>Alan Turing came up with an idea, what if we develop a new kind of machine whose instructions weren&rsquo;t hardcoded
in a sense into it. The machine would need to have the programs loaded into typically by magnetic tape, etc.
A completly new world of things could be done, more efficiently and fast. Worth mentioning that this
miracle hardware (Named the Turing Machine) evolved into what we know today as a &ldquo;Computer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now, follow me with your mind, regain conscience and start reading with the meaning of the words. I want you to do
the following; Imagine a big red circle, now imagine it inside a nasty bathroom. Then play your favorite song in your mind, easy no? You just used your brain as Google Maps, Adobe Photoshop and Spotify. Without thinking of them,
without any latency and without switching brains or something. This is what we all call imagination, the most
powerful software we could ever made/have/had.</p>
<p>Capable is our mind; all our ideas, emotions and even physical actions run throught it. Since the times of
Ada&rsquo;s, ideas of multipurpose machine were inimaginable, but possible as proven by humans themeselves. Being capable
of walking and talking at the same time, while being conscious about it. Now im reimaging the computer, just being
able to run one software, but that software being a non-purpose one. You use it for everything and nothing at the
same time.</p>
<p>Just trying to predict future investigations, maybe one scientific will find this while being locked down in his
room minutes later after finding out how our brain works. Im not a genius but i like to reflect on some daily
thoughts.</p>
<p>Epilogue:
I just remebered why i titled this Interface, &lsquo;cause i&rsquo;ve always wanted a brain-computer connection. Magic.</p>
